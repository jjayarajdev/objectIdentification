SCENE TYPE (choose one):
- indoor_office
- indoor_residential
- indoor_commercial
- indoor_industrial
- building_exterior
- land_property
- construction_site
- infrastructure
- parking_area
- other

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Comprehensive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs):
   - Overall scene description
   - Purpose and function of the space
   - Condition assessment
   - Notable features and characteristics

2. **Detailed Object Table**:
   Count EVERYTHING visible. Be exhaustive. Include:
   - EXACT counts (e.g., "9 Individuals", "3 Chairs", "1 Desk")
   - Specific descriptions with colors, materials, conditions
   - Precise positions in the image
   - Estimated costs in INR where applicable

   Categories to check:
   - People (count individuals, describe activities)
   - Furniture (desks, chairs, tables, cabinets, etc.)
   - Lighting (fixtures, lamps, natural light sources)
   - Electronics/Equipment (computers, monitors, printers, etc.)
   - Flooring/Ceiling (type, condition, materials)
   - Walls/Partitions (materials, colors, conditions)
   - Doors/Windows (count, type, materials)
   - Plants/Decor (indoor plants, artwork, decorations)
   - Signage (signs, labels, boards)
   - Safety/Security (cameras, alarms, emergency equipment)
   - HVAC (air conditioning, ventilation, heating)
   - Storage (shelves, racks, storage units)
   - Infrastructure (cables, pipes, electrical fixtures)
   - Vehicles (if parking/outdoor)
   - Building Elements (structural features)

3. **Key Observations** (5-8 bullet points):
   - Most important findings
   - Maintenance needs
   - Safety concerns
   - Recommendations

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for simplified_data:
1. ALWAYS include exact counts in the "object" field (e.g., "9 Individuals" not just "Individuals")
2. Use standard categories: People, Furniture, Lighting, Electronics, Flooring, Ceiling, Walls, Doors, Windows, Plants, Signage, Safety, HVAC, Storage, Infrastructure, Vehicle, Building Element
3. Include estimated_cost in INR for items where applicable (use "‚Äî" if not applicable)
4. Be specific about positions (e.g., "Center of room", "Left wall", "Near entrance")
5. Provide detailed descriptions with colors, materials, conditions
6. List EVERY distinct item - aim for 15-30+ entries for detailed scenes
7. Count similar items together (e.g., "5 Ceiling Lights" not separate entries for each)

Examples of proper format:
- {"category": "People", "object": "3 Pedestrians", "details": "Two women and one man in casual clothing walking together", "position": "Center foreground", "estimated_cost": "‚Äî"}
- {"category": "Furniture", "object": "4 Workstations", "details": "Modular cubicles with grey panels, each with desk surface", "position": "Along north wall", "estimated_cost": "‚Çπ120,000"}
- {"category": "Electronics", "object": "6 Computer Monitors", "details": "24-inch LED displays, Dell brand, mounted on adjustable arms", "position": "On desks throughout", "estimated_cost": "‚Çπ90,000"}
- {"category": "Flooring", "object": "Vinyl Tile Flooring", "details": "Grey commercial-grade vinyl tiles, approximately 500 sq ft, showing some wear", "position": "Entire floor area", "estimated_cost": "‚Çπ75,000"}

Be thorough and professional. This analysis will be used for property valuation and facility management."""
